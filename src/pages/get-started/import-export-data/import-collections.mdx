# Importing Collections 

It's very common that users transition to Bruno from another tool, or chose to use Bruno while their colleagues may chose something else. 

Whatever the case, we allow for importing of the formats as Bruno Collections:

- Bruno Collection (if a Collection is manually shared with you)
- Postman Collection
- Insomnia Collection
- Cloning a Git Repository

> `Cloning a Git Repository` is only available in our Golden and Ultimate Editions. Please see Collaboration and Versioning for more details.

### Importing Process

Either click `Import Collection` on the home screen of Bruno or select the elipses in the top-left corner then navigate to `Import Collection`.
